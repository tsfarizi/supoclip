1. Read [Setup](./setup.md) to get the app running.
2. Review [Configuration](./configuration.md) to understand environment variables and operating modes.
3. Use [App Guide](./app-guide.md) to learn the user-facing parts of the product.
4. Use [Architecture](./architecture.md) to understand how the system works end to end.
5. Use [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) when something goes wrong.

## What SupoClip Is

SupoClip is an open-source AI video clipping application. It takes long-form videos, transcribes them, uses an LLM to select the most promising short segments, and renders vertical or source-aspect clips with subtitles and optional effects.

The current repository snapshot includes:

- `frontend/`: the main Next.js application
- `backend/`: the FastAPI API and ARQ worker code
- Root-level infrastructure files such as `.prototools`, `init.sql`, `.env.example`, `run.ps1`, and `stop.ps1`

Repository guidance still mentions a separate `waitlist/` app, but that directory is not present in this checkout. The documentation in this folder reflects the repository as it exists now.
